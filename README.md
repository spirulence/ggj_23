## Transient Team GGJ '23 Repository

Hi there. We're assembling a few basecodes that could be used as a starting point for a game made during Global Game Jam 2023 in this repository.

Eventually, there will be a chosen project that lives here also.

At the moment, see `basecodes/spacerock-blasters/README.md` for more information.

## Development Tools

You'll need Node 18 installed for the tools here to work. Using VS Code with a "devcontainer" is highly recommended, as this will pre-install Node and other tools in a throwaway development environment.

To get code formatting working, we install the "Prettier - VS Code" extension along with a local copy of prettier. Run `npm install` in this directory to get the local copy of prettier installed.
